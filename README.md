## Waker - A time management app designed for early birds

Waker is a to-do list app with additional functionalities. The goal of the project was to facilitate morning routine planning by providing a UI built to handle rapid schedule changes. Easily create tasks, delete and edit their time lengths, and drag and drop to sort them into your schedule as you see fit. 

## Features:
- Create tasks to populate your task pool
- Delete tasks as needed
- Filter for your favorite tasks
- Drag and drop tasks into calendar zone
- Sort multiple tasks by dragging and dropping
- Increase or decrease the time intervals of tasks with interactive buttons
- All tasks in your task pool and calendar are saved in localStorage for easy access. 

## Important things to note:
- This app uses the React-DnD library, which relies on the HTML5 drag and drop API.
- This means that the app will not work devices with touchscreens.
